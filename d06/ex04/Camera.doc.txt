<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Camera class handles Camera object.

Constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:

’origin’: The vertex positioning the camera in the world mark. Thanks to this
vertex, we can compute a vector and then a translation matrix.

’orientation’: Rotation matrix orienting the camera in the world mark.

’width’: Width in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio. Not
compatible with the ’ratio’ key.

’height’: Height in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio.
Not compatible with the ’ratio’ key.

’ratio’: Image’s ratio. Not compatible with the ’width’ and ’height’ keys.

’fov’ : The projected image’s field of view in in degree.

’near’ : The near clipping plane.

’far’ : The far clipping plane.

Camera Class has following method:

Vertex watchVertex( Vertex $worldVertex ) : Transforms "world" coordinates
vertex into a "screen" coordinates vertex (a pixel basically).
